  <h1>Description</h1>
  <p>This peri peri chicken recipe features 
    a great spicy marinade for an African dish 
    that's great for a barbecue. Nice with salad and fries, 
    but I like adding it to a pita with salad and garlic Greek yogurt 
    (3/4 cup Greek yogurt and 3 cloves of crushed garlic with finely chopped chives). 
    Don't go on a date, though; 
    it gives you wicked garlic breath!</p>
  <h1> Ingredients</h1>
  <ul>
     <li> 1 cup fresh lemon juice</li>
     <li> 1/4 cup paprika</li>
     <li> 2 tablespoons hot chili powder</li>
     <li> 3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
     <li> 1 1/2 teaspoons chopped fresh ginger</li>
     <li> 1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
     <li> 4 bone-in chicken breast halves</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Directions</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>Stir together lemon juice, 
      paprika, chili powder, garlic, ginger, 
      and salt in a large bowl until well combined.
       Add chicken; rub until well coated and marinate in the refrigerator for 3 hours.  </li>
    <li>Preheat a grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grates.</li>
    <li>Place chicken onto the preheated grill; 
      discard marinade. Cook, turning occasionally, 
      until skins are slightly charred and the juices 
      run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read 
      thermometer inserted into the center of chicken 
      should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).  </li>
  </ol>
<h2> Editor's Note: </h2>
